        <h1 style="color: white;"><center>What is <span style="font-style: italic; color: coral;">Data Structure and Algorithm?</span></center></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">You may already know that computers are used to store and modify massive amounts of data. Data structures 
            are used to efficiently and conveniently arrange and store data.</p>

        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and used effectively is known as a 
            data structure. In addition to defining the relationships between data pieces, it offers a means of 
            representing and storing data. Common data structures include trees, stacks, queues, linked lists, 
            arrays, and stacks.</p>
            
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Now, an algorithm is a set of guidelines or procedures used to complete a task or solve a problem. 
            To get a certain outcome, algorithms are used to alter data that is stored in data structures. Data 
            in an array or linked list can be sorted using a sorting algorithm, for instance.</p>
            
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Data structures and algorithms are closely associated in computer science because an algorithm’s 
            effectiveness frequently depends on the selection of an effective data structure. An algorithm 
            can become more effective and quick with the right data format. For instance, a hash table is 
            a popular data structure for quick data retrieval and searching.</p>
            
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">It is impossible to emphasize the significance of data structures and algorithms in computer science. 
            Writing effective computer programs requires an understanding of these fundamental ideas, 
            which serve as the cornerstone of software development.</p>
            
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">For example, suppose you are creating software to look for a specific name in a large client database. 
            Your program’s effectiveness will be influenced by the algorithm and data format you choose. Your 
            software could take a long time to finish the search if you pick a poor data structure or technique. 
            Yet, your program will run more quickly and efficiently if you select an effective data structure 
            and algorithm.</p>
        <h1><center>What are <span style="font-style: italic; color: darkkhaki;">Data Structures and types?</span></center></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Data structures are specific methods for setting up and keeping data in a computer so that it may be 
            accessed, changed, and searched quickly. There are many different kinds of data structures, and 
            each has benefits and drawbacks that vary depending on the objectives of the application.</p>
        <h2>1. Arrays</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Arrays are a type of data structure that keep a group of identically categorised elements in close 
            proximity to one another in memory. Despite having a fixed size, they can be ineffective for dynamic 
            data or big datasets since they require constant-time access to individual items via an index.</p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Index-based constant-time access to individual elements</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">For tiny, fixed-size data sets, effective</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Simple to use and understand</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Uniform size</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Ineffective for large or dynamic data set</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
            <p style="font-size: 17px;">a list of contact details</p>

            <p style="font-size: 17px;">a list of test results</p>
        <h2>2. Linked Lists</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Linked lists are a type of data structure that are made up of a series of nodes, each of which contains 
            an element and a reference to the node after it in the list. They are distinguished by their speedy 
            insert and delete of elements, but because of their non-contiguous memory allocation, their traversal 
            may be slower than arrays.</p>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Effective element addition and deletion</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Varying size</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Memory-efficient</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Traversing more slowly than arrays</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Less effective for gaining access to specific elements</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">a musical playlist</p>

        <p style="font-size: 17px;">books listed</p>
        <h1><center>What are <span style="font-style: italic; color: darkkhaki;">Algorithms and types?</span></center></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Algorithms are a collection of instructions or rules that must be followed in order to complete a task or 
            solve an issue. There are many different kinds of algorithms, and each has benefits and drawbacks that 
            vary depending on the particular issue being solved.</p>
        <h2>1. Recursive Algorithms</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Recursive algorithms are those that call themselves in order to solve a problem. They can be applied to 
            a wide range of issues, including search and sorting algorithms.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Using the Fibonacci sequence to traverse a binary tree</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Able to solve challenging issues</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Can some cases be more effective than non-recursive algorithms</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">For some issues, it might be simpler to comprehend and put into practice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Potentially memory-intensive compared to non-recursive algorithms
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">May some circumstances be less effective than non-recursive algorithms</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2. Greedy Algorithms</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Greedy Algorithms: In order to achieve a globally optimal solution, greedy algorithms choose the locally 
            optimal option at each step. They are frequently employed for optimization issues.</p>
        <h3>Examples:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">The issue with coin exchange</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pros:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Able to solve problems fast</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Frequently offer accurate approximations to ideal answers</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">Can be applied to a variety of issues</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Cons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">May not always come up with the world’s best answer</li>
            <li style="font-size: 17px;">It can be challenging to decide when a greedy algorithm is necessary.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><center>Purpose, Functionality, <span style="font-style: italic; color: darkkhaki;">and</span> Implementation</center></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">Data structures offer a mechanism to organize and store data so that it can be retrieved and used 
            effectively. They also provide functionality and implementation. They are used in many different 
            applications, including web development, database management systems, artificial intelligence and 
            machine learning, gaming, and operating systems. They are made to maximise the usage of memory and 
            computing capacity.</p>
        <h1><center>Future of <span style="font-style: italic; color: darkkhaki;">Data Structure and Algorithm</span></center></h1>
        <p style="font-size: 17px;">The advancement of technology will have a significant impact on how data structures and algorithms 
            are used in the future. The demand for more efficient and effective data structures and algorithms 
            will grow in significance as technology progresses.</p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 17px;"> Here are some prospective fields for development and innovation:</h3>
        <ul>
